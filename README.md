# Experimental Data and Scripts
This repository contains experimental data and scripts used for performance evaluation. The data includes results from various measurements and the scripts are designed to collect CPU, memory, network throughput, and database throughput metrics.

# Contents
### data.zip
This file contains the experimental data generated during the evaluation. The data is organized into Excel files, with each file corresponding to a specific experiment. The experiment number can be found at the end of the Excel file names.

### scripts.zip
This file contains the scripts used to collect various performance metrics, including CPU usage, memory usage, network throughput, and database throughput. These scripts were used to monitor and analyze the system during the experiments.

# How to Use
Download and extract the **data.zip** and **scripts.zip** files.
Review the Excel files in data.zip for detailed experimental results.
Use the scripts in scripts.zip to replicate the performance data collection process.
